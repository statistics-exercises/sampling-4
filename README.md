# Generating box plots

The panda data frame is a tool that is used by statisticians to analyse the data.  It should thus come as no surprise to find that you can use this tool to calculate the mean, median and percentiles of a data set with a single line command.  These operations are standard things that statisticians do every day so of course someone was going to write a tool to calculate these things quickly.

Another thing statisticians do regularly is that they visualise data.  In the next few exercises I am going to show you how we can use panda data frames to visualise the data in the frame directly.  If you run the code in the panel on the left here a box plot indicating the range of the data, the interquartile rang and the median for the revenue of the films.  The box plot is generated by the command:

````
movies_df['revenue_millions'].plot(kind="box")
````

Change this command to generate box plots for some of the other variables in the data frame.  Once you are content that you understand this command press submit.  There are no tests to pass for this particular exercise. 

the `get_figure().savefig("boxplot.png")` part of the command is necessary to get the box plot to appear on repl.  If you use this command in a python notebook, however, you do not need to add these commands and can just use the command from the code block in the description above.
